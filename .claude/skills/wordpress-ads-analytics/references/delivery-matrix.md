## Stale banner triage

1. Compare source configuration with rendered origin HTML.
2. Compare referenced creative bytes or validators (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`, length) at origin and each edge.
3. Identify whether stale data belongs to Blocksy/Composer, WordPress object cache, WP Rocket page cache, Cloudflare, or an RU edge.
4. Invalidate only the affected page/asset keys at the first divergent layer.
5. Recheck cold and warm requests through every route.

The current expected top creative is `/wp-content/uploads/2026/07/728x90.jpg`. The known obsolete Playerok creative `/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/heartstone_sajt.png.webp` must not reappear.
